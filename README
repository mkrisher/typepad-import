-------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG:

03/19/09: R1

- task will now accept url from a config or prompt, will parse the feed
	adding entries to the database table. While doing so it will fix the 
	typepad links and make them relative, as well as pull in local copies
	of embedded images and change the paths in the content to be local.


03/18/09: PR2

- task will now accept a url and parse the feed, adding entries to the 
	database table. Just needs some content massaging

03/17/09: PR1

- starting the rake task to import data from Typepad feed

-------------------------------------------
Description:

- this rake task will ask the user for a Typepad feed URL and 
	will import that feed into a local database table. Can be used 
	for archiving, legacy data use in new Rails app, etc...

-------------------------------------------
Usage:

- the task has a couple of dependencies. the first is the database table.
	1) run rake db:migrate
	
	the task writes images to the /public/images directory if there are any 
	images embedded in posts. when writing the local copy, links are updated 
	to reference the local paths. in addition to the images, permalinks are 
	rewritten as well to be relative.
	2) be sure to add routes for /:year/:month/:link
